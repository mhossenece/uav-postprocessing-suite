## ✨ Overview

This MATLAB-based post-processing suite provides a full pipeline to evaluate the performance of UAV-assisted wireless data collection missions. It converts raw log files into structured datasets, computes key performance metrics, and visualizes mission results, enabling in-depth analysis of throughput, fairness, and coverage in multi-base-station scenarios.

---

## ⚙️ Workflow Summary

1. **Convert** raw telemetry (`controller_log.txt`, `vehicleOut.txt`) to CSV  
2. **Merge** SNR and download data with UAV GPS logs  
3. **Compute** data volumes, cumulative download, and final mission score  
4. **Visualize**:
   - UAV trajectory + geofence + eNodeBs
   - Download progress vs. time
   - Remaining data per base station
   - Final score breakdown

## 🧠 Developed for AADM Challenge

This framework was developed as part of the **AERPAW Autonomous Data Mule (AADM) Challenge #2**, a UAV competition organized by the **AERPAW platform**. The objective is to design UAV algorithms that dynamically optimize trajectory and base station selection to maximize throughput and minimize latency under real-time constraints.
