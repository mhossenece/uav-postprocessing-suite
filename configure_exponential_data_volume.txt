For this ranking, we consider a total data volume of 3000 Mbits and define two challenge vectors:

Challenge-1 (unordered): [1931.74, 96.18, 710.65, 261.43]
Challenge-2 (ordered): [1931.74, 710.65, 261.43, 96.18]

Let’s say you want to work with the data volume mentioned in Challenge-1. The question is: how can you work with this exponentially distributed data volume? Or, how can you assign the data volume to each base station (BS)?

To do this, you should access the node that represents the Controller (LW1). There is no need to configure the following steps for the other nodes (UAV, LW2, LW3, LW4); only perform them on LW1.

You can choose one of the following methods:

(i) Update the uniform.txt file:
Type the following in the LW1 EVM console:
	nano /root/Profiles/AADMChallenge/Coordinator/uniform.txt

Then, remove any existing values and replace them with:
	1931.74
	96.18
	710.65
	261.43

After that, press Ctrl+S to save and Ctrl+X to exit.


(ii) Modify the controllerHelper.sh script:
Type: 
	nano /root/Profiles/ProfileScripts/Other/Helpers/controllerHelper.sh
You will see:
	PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python3 Controller.py --file $VOLUME_FILE
	# PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python3 Controller.py --volumes 100 200 300 234

Comment out the first line:
	#PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python3 Controller.py --file $VOLUME_FILE
Then uncomment and modify the second line as follows:
	PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python3 Controller.py --volumes 1931.74 96.18 710.65 261.43

So the final result should look like:
	#PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python3 Controller.py --file $VOLUME_FILE
	PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python3 Controller.py --volumes 1931.74 96.18 710.65 261.43

Save and exit using Ctrl+S and Ctrl+X.

(iii) Modify both controllerHelper.sh and exponential.txt:
Open the helper script:
	nano /root/Profiles/ProfileScripts/Other/Helpers/controllerHelper.sh
Change the file reference from uniform.txt to exponential.txt:
	VOLUME_FILE="exponential.txt"  # Path to your file
Then open the exponential file:
	nano /root/Profiles/AADMChallenge/Coordinator/exponential.txt
Replace the existing values with:
	1931.74
	96.18
	710.65
	261.43
Save and exit using Ctrl+S and Ctrl+X.


Once you have set the data volume, you donot need to repeat these steps. Your experiment is now ready to use the exponential data volume assigned to each BS.

After using one of the three approaches, and once your UAV reaches an altitude of 25 meters, you can verify the data volume on the portable node's EVM by running:
	cat /root/Profiles/AADMChallenge/PortableNode/dv.txt

[Optional – only if necessary]
If you find that the expected data volume is not being set correctly, re-copy the controller script before starting the experiment:
	cp /root/Profiles/ProfileScripts/Other/Samples/startAADMCoordinator.sh /root/Profiles/ProfileScripts/Other/startController.sh
